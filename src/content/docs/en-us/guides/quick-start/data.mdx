## Importing Data

By calling the `createUniverSheet` method of `Univer`, you can create a new instance of `Workbook`. The method takes an object as its first parameter, which should adhere to the `IWorkbookData` interface.

```ts
import { IWorkbookData } from "@univerjs/core";

// ... create the Univer instance and load plugins

const data: IWorkbookData = {};
const workbook = univer.createUniverSheet(data);
```

## Exporting Data

By calling the `save` method of `Workbook`, you can obtain an `IWorkbookData` object containing the data within the spreadsheet.

```ts
const savedData = workbook.save();
```
